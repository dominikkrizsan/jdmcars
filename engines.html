            <div>
                <p class="car-text">The alphabet soup actually means something: "RB" was Nissan's '80s-generation
                    inline-six engine family, although the RB26DETT bears only a passing resemblance to other RB engines
                    in the marque's inline-six family; "26" is the displacement (2.6 liters, or 158-cu.in.); "D" is for
                    the double overhead-cam valvetrain layout; "E" is for electronic fuel injection (or possibly for the
                    German name for fuel injection, einspritzer); "TT" stands for twin turbo.Rather than a tweaked
                    street engine, the RB26DETT was a race engine, its bore and stroke carefully calculated for FIA
                    Group A touring-car racing dominance, then detuned for the street. Its big bore and short stroke
                    (86-mm bore, 71.7-mm stroke) means that it yearns to rev clear through its 8,000-rpm redline. Cast
                    pistons had oil squirters to help cool them down, exhaust valves were sodium-filled, and the valve
                    actuation was via solid lifters. The RB26DETT had six individual throttle-bodies— really three sets
                    of two-throat throttle bodies—mounted to the side of the block in the manner of side-draft
                    carburetors of ye olden days of yore. The RB26DETT is rated at 276 hp. This is a lie. In Japan, car
                    manufacturers worked under a voluntary "gentlemen's agreement" that they wouldn't advertise cars
                    with more than 280 pferdestärke (an internationally recognized power measurement that works out to
                    276 hp). Engines may well make that power, but they wouldn't be advertised as such; this would be
                    downplayed so that the car companies could seem like more responsible corporate citizens. (The
                    agreement has since dissolved).

                <p class="car-text pt-5 mt-5">To make the Toyota Supra MK4 a more high-performance car, Toyota began to
                    use 2 engines in the Supra. The first engine that they used was the 2JZ-GE engine. This was a
                    naturally aspirated engine. This type of engine does not rely on forced induction through a
                    turbocharger. It gets its power when the internal combustion gets power from its oxygen intake,
                    which depends solely on atmospheric pressure. This is a type of engine used by sports car because it
                    helps to avoid turbo lag. This engine was capable of 220hp.
                    The MK 4 also featured a twin-turbocharged 2JZ-GTE engine. This engine variation increased hp to
                    320. It is interesting to note that the twin turbochargers worked sequentially, instead of in
                    parallel. It works by sending all of the exhaust first turbine, which results in reduced lag. At
                    3500 RPM, some exhaust is then rerouted to the 2nd turbine. By 4000 RPM, the second turbine’s output
                    is used to augment the first one’s output. This resulted in a greater boost and enhanced torque.
                    Using the twin turbos in this way gives a much higher RPM boost. To go along with this new engine,
                    Toyota also added a new 6-speed gearbox.

                <p class="car-text pt-3">The most sought after and arguably the most popular B-Series engine comes from
                    the B18C family. The B18C engine inherits the best of all the B-Series has to offer, with a 1.8L
                    displacement and DOHC VTEC technology. The B18C could be found in many different variations, similar
                    to the B16A where the Japanese-spec engines were simply B18C, while the American-spec were B18C1s in
                    the GS-R and B18C5s in the Type-R. Versions of the Japanese-spec B18C were found in both the popular
                    Integra Si-R and Type-R. While there was no way to differentiate between the two engines, the Type-R
                    B18C built 197 hp compared to the Si-R version’s 178 hp.
